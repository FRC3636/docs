# SysID

SysID (short for System Identification) is an app that is used to predict PID and Feedforward controller gains. It works by analyzing the velocity and position changes of a motor as a voltage is applied to it. It uses this date to estimate the theoretical optimal constants.

## Preparation

The most important part of using SysID is creating and using a `SysIdRoutine` object in your robot code. When enabled, it calculates what changing or constant voltage should be applied to a system like an arm, elevator, or flywheel.

To set up a SysID routine, start by adding a `setVoltage` method to a subsystem's I/O layer:

```kotlin
interface ElevatorIO {
    // ...
    fun setVoltage(voltage: Voltage)
}
```

Implement it in each version of the I/O layer. For example, when using a TalonFX, the `VoltageOut` control request can be used. It's important ensure that when running SysID routines, the same method of motor control is used as when running the subsystem for real (for example, if using FOC for extra power, it should be enabled both during SysID and real motor usage).

```kotlin
class ElevatorIOTalon {
    private val motor = TalonFX().apply {
        // ... configuration ...
    }

    private val voltageControl = VoltageOut(0.0).apply {
        EnableFOC = true
    }

    override fun setVoltage(voltage: Voltage) {
        motor.setControl(voltageControl.withOutput(voltage.inVolts()))
    }
}
```

Then, back in the subsystem object, create a SysID object and the commands that activate it. When tuning a Phoenix 6 device, you should use the Phoenix 6 `SignalLogger` which automatically collects position, voltage, and velocity from motors:

```kotlin
object Elevator: Subsystem {
    private val io: ElevatorIO = ElevatorIOTalon()

    private val sysId = SysIdRoutine(
        SysIdRoutine.Config(
            0.5.voltsPerSecond, // Voltage change rate for quasistatic routine
            2.volts, // Constant voltage value for dynamic routine
            null, // Max time before automatically ending the routine
            {
                // Called when a routine is begun or ended
                // `it` contains the routine name and direction in a format parsable by SysID.
                SignalLogger.writeString("state", it.toString())
            }
        ),
        SysIdRoutine.Mechanism(
            io::setVoltage, // Set voltage of mechanism
            null, // Log voltage of mechanism (handled by SignalLogger already)
            this,
        )
    )

    // These commands delegate to the ones generated by SysID.
    fun sysIdQuasistatic(direction: Direction) = sysId.quasistatic(direction)!!
    fun sysIdDynamic(direction: Direction) = sysId.dynamic(direction)!!
}
```

Finally, add the bindings for the command to the `Robot` file.

```kotlin
private fun configureBindings() {
    // Start logging position, velocity, voltage, etc of all TalonFX motors.
    controller.leftBumper().onTrue(Commands.runOnce(SignalLogger::start))
    controller.rightBumper().onTrue(Commands.runOnce(SignalLogger::stop))

    controller.y().whileTrue(Elevator.sysIdQuasistatic(SysIdRoutine.Direction.kForward));
    controller.a().whileTrue(Elevator.sysIdQuasistatic(SysIdRoutine.Direction.kReverse));
    controller.b().whileTrue(Elevator.sysIdDynamic(SysIdRoutine.Direction.kForward));
    controller.x().whileTrue(Elevator.sysIdDynamic(SysIdRoutine.Direction.kReverse));
}
```

## Routines

To run the routines and collect the data SysID needs, start by enabling the robot. Press Left Trigger to start logging data from TalonFX motors, then use each one of A/B/X/Y to run a routine on the mechanism. Pressing the button will start the mechanism and releasing will stop it by setting the output voltage to zero.

Turn off the TalonFX signal logger (right trigger) and disable the robot.

It might take a few attempts to run the routines successfully! Here are some tips for getting good results:

1. **Only run each routine once**: Don't press A/B/X/Y multiple times - SysID doesn't understand multiple runs and it will look as though the mechanism "jumped" to it.
2. **Don't hit the hard stop**: Running the mechanism past the end of its range of motion might cause SysID to think the mechanism has more friction than it actually does.
3. **Slow it down**: If the routine is running too fast to record high-quality data, change the parameters passed to `SysIdRoutine.Config` to make it run slower.

## Retrieving data

The next step is to download the log data so that SysID can analyze it.

When not using TalonFX, SysID logs must be downloaded onto your laptop using the RoboRIO Data Log Tool (downloads available online).

Otherwise, use Phoenix Tuner X (downloads also available online) and follow the instructions on this page <https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/stable/docs/tuner/tools/log-extractor.html>.
