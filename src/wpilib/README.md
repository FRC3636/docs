# Using WPILib

Virtually all FRC teams,
including 3636,
use the WPILib library
to program their robots.
This section explains 
how to get started with WPILib
and use it to program a robot.

You will learn how to:

- install WPILib and a suitable development environment;
- create a command-based WPILib project;
- build and deploy your code to a physical robot;
- create subsystems to abstract robot mechanisms;
- create commands to abstract robot actions;
- and bring it all together to drive a robot.
