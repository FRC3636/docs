# The Development Environment

Before you can start
programming a robot,
you'll need to install
some software.

See also: [WPILib's guide](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html).

## Installing WPILib

WPILib provides installers
for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

First,
you'll need to download
the latest release of WPILib
from GitHub Releases.
You can follow [this link](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases/latest)
and then scroll down until you find the "Assets" section.

After you download and run the installer,
it will prompt you to choose to install "tools only" or "everything."
Unless you already have a preferred code editor installed,
you should choose "everything"
and select "download for this computer only"
when it prompts you to install VS Code.

## Setting up Your Editor (optional)

If you chose not to install VS Code with the WPILib installer,
you'll probably want to set up your editor of choice
for use with WPILib.

First, you'll want Java IDE support.
This comes built in on most IDEs such as IntelliJ,
but if not you may need to find and install a plugin.

Then, you should install the WPILib extension,
if there is one for your editor.
VS Code has [an official extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wpilibsuite.vscode-wpilib)
and IntelliJ has this well-supported [community plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9405-frc).
