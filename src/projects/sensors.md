# Sensors

Sensors are an integral part of FRC robot programming. They allow you to easily automate tasks that would otherwise take driver attention. 

Most sensors that you will use are going to plug into the DIO (Digital Input/Output) ports on the robot. 

### Project Materials
* Romi Robot
* Limit Switch 
* Laptop with VS Code installed

### Project Goal
The goal with this project is to add a sensor to the front of your robot that will stop you from driving straight into a wall or other objects.

// Getting romi set up along with pictures of how it should look

// Explain `DigitalInput` class

// Example subsystem code with `DigitalInput` initialized
